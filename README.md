Here you will find some of the various projects I've worked on during my tenure at Westward Summit. 

Master Data is the Excel workbook I work with on a daily basis. There are multiple sheets that extrapolate data from [the primary table name]. Although this table is primarily raw data and quick calculations, there are key metrics located here that help us see in a quick spot check whether or not the particular batch did well or not. On the sheet [ranking] is where each of the aggregate score of each strain is compared to all the other strains, which then informs my stakeholders on which products to retire and which ones to increase production. 

In the [powerbi] project, there are extensive breakdowns of how each strain performs, as well as financial analyses and breakdowns of our company. We started in Q4 of 2020, so most data begins Q1 of 2021 when we were more in control of the business as opposed to the process set in motion by the previous owners of the building/business.
