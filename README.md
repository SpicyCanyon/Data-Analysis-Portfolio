Westward Summit Complete Data Analysis

Contained within this repository will be (note the "will be", as this is still a work in progress) the complete findings of all the data collected, cleaned, transformed, and finally presented in a digestible way for anyone to be able to understand. These findings will include the humble beginnings of the barebones data, collected by the owner of the company. Once I took the data collection upon myself, I expanded the aspects that could be found slowly at first, until I created a scoring system that graded each harvested strain with a score out of 100. This included being scored on THC content, pounds harvested per plant, the percent yield of top shelf product, and how low the percent of shake/trim was. 

This overall score helps to paint a picture how each individual strain did in each harvest. It can then be aggregated by each strain to gauge performance in regards to decide on which product lines to continue, and which ones to retire. This score can also help paint a picture of how the growing department is doing. Just like any business, Westward Summit is no different in that there is a neverending strive for perfection. We use this score to determine if any changes in our process are successful or not, as you will see in the additional materials. 

This repository contains demonstrations of my abilities and will contain examples of use cases of 

##Excel:
  VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Power Query, EOMONTH formulas for establishing if a harvest was within the certain timeframe, numerous instances of IF statements (espeically in the scoring system) 

##Power BI:
  Crafting of visualizations in Power BI

##Google Sheets:
  Interwoven sheets sharing data using IMPORTRANGE, assorted usages of logical operators, SORT, ARRAYFORMULA, and FILTER formulas. These are a combination of private and public-facing forms that contain our inventory that is available for sale, as well as multiple documents that keep track of internal progress and eventually use these figures to determine payroll as well as performance of each employee.

Stay tuned and make sure to keep checking back, as more and more documents will be finished and uploaded in the coming days and weeks. 

I hope you enjoy following along with me as I give you an inside peek at the inner workings of a cannabis business.
